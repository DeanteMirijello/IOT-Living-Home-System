<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>
    This Smart Home Automation & Security System was created as part of the 
    <strong>Fall 2025 IoT: Design and Prototyping of Connected Devices</strong> course.
</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    This system integrates multiple sensors, actuators, and cloud services to provide 
    real-time monitoring, automation, and remote control capabilities. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>DHT22 sensor for temperature & humidity monitoring</li>
    <li>PIR motion sensor for security/intrusion detection</li>
    <li>Three LEDs (yellow/green/red) for status indicators</li>
    <li>Servo motor for door/lock control</li>
    <li>Buzzer for alerts</li>
    <li>Adafruit IO for cloud communication (MQTT + REST API)</li>
    <li>Flask Web App using Chart.js for live & historical data visualization</li>
    <li>NeonDB (PostgreSQL) for cloud-based historical data storage</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Live sensor dashboard with real-time charts</li>
    <li>Historical environmental data visualization</li>
    <li>Security system control + intrusion logs</li>
    <li>Remote device control (LEDs, servo, buzzer)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>
    The Raspberry Pi reads the sensors and controls the actuators.  
    It publishes data to Adafruit IO and stores time-series data 
    in a cloud PostgreSQL database (NeonDB).  
    The Flask web application retrieves data from both the cloud and local APIs,
    displaying it to the user through interactive charts and controls.
