System overview and block diagrams
This project is a complete IoT Smart Home Automation & Security System built around a Raspberry Pi that integrates multiple sensors, actuators, and cloud services to provide real-time monitoring, remote control, and automated security features. The Pi collects temperature, humidity, and motion data using a DHT22 sensor and PIR detector, controls devices such as LEDs, a servo motor, and a buzzer, and communicates with Adafruit IO through MQTT and REST for live dashboards and remote commands. All sensor readings are logged both locally (SQLite) and in a cloud PostgreSQL database (NeonDB), with automatic synchronization whenever the Pi regains internet connectivity. A Flask web application displays live data using Chart.js, shows historical trends retrieved from the cloud database, supports device control, and provides an interface for managing the home security system and viewing intrusion logs. Together, these components form a robust, modular, cloud-connected smart home platform.

  The hardest aspect of this project was working with the Pi camera. After a lot of time and effort I was never able to get it to work. I tried redownloading the Pi OS as well as replugging and rebooting it, but in the end I never got it to work.
  
  Most of the other parts worked in the project and it was really nice to see all the parts interact and come together in the end to make one machine. I will definitely keep this project together for a day I would like to show it off or even improve on it.
  
  There is, however, still things I would’ve liked to improve on. Apart from getting the camera to work, I would have also liked to make the servo motor open the lid of the box instead of just being a fan. I would also like to add more LEDs that can show when other actuators or sensors are working.
